            focus on domestic life, particularly in the context of women’s roles during the 18th and early 19th

            unrecognized during her lifetime, but her novels, including Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility,
            Emma, and Mansfield Park, have since become literary classics, cherished for their insightful portrayal of
            human relationships and their lasting influence on the romance genre. Pride and Prejudice, first published
            in 1813, is considered her most famous and beloved work. It tells the

            <h3>"1984" by George Orwell :</h3>
        </li>

        <p>George Orwell (1903–1950) was an English writer, journalist, and essayist, best known for his works that
            critique totalitarianism, social injustice, and the misuse of power. His real name was Eric Arthur Blair,
            but he adopted the pen name George Orwell for his writing.Orwell’s works are celebrated for their political
            insight, clarity of prose, and deep moral concern. He was
            deeply influenced by his experiences with imperialism, class struggles, and the rise of totalitarian regimes
            in the 20th century. Some of his key works include Animal Farm (1945) and 1984 (1949).1984, perhaps his most
            famous work, is a dystopian novel that explores the dangers of a totalitarian
            government led by the omnipresent, authoritarian figure known as Big Brother. The novel examines themes such
            as surveillance, propaganda, loss of individuality, and the erosion of truth. It serves as a powerful
            warning about the potential consequences of unchecked political power and the importance of personal
            freedom.Orwell's works continue to be highly relevant and influential, often cited in discussions of
            political
            freedom, censorship, and human rights.</p>

            <h3>"To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee :</h3>
        </li>

        <p>Harper Lee (1926–2016) was an American author best known for her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel To Kill a
            Mockingbird (1960). Born in Monroeville, Alabama, Lee drew upon her own experiences growing up in the South
            to create vivid depictions of the complexities of race, class, and morality in her writing.Lee's most famous
            work, To Kill a Mockingbird, addresses themes of racial injustice, the loss of innocence,
            and the importance of empathy. Set in the 1930s during the Great Depression, the novel tells the story of
            Scout Finch, a young girl whose father, Atticus Finch, defends a Black man, Tom Robinson, falsely accused of
            raping a white woman in the deeply segregated town of Maycomb, Alabama.Despite being her only novel
            published during her lifetime, To Kill a Mockingbird became a landmark work in
            American literature, widely praised for its compelling characters and its powerful social commentary. Harper
            Lee's writing was influenced by her observations of the racial prejudices and struggles she witnessed in the
            South, and she is remembered as a strong voice for justice and equality.</p>

            <h3>"Moby-Dick" by Herman Melville :</h3>
        </li>

        <p>
            Herman Melville (1819–1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet, best known for his
            masterpiece Moby-Dick, a novel often hailed as one of the greatest works of American literature. Melville
            was born in New York City and had a varied career, including working as a sailor on whaling ships, which
            deeply influenced his writing, especially Moby-Dick.Melville’s early works were successful, but it was
            Moby-Dick, published in 1851, that would later secure his
            place in literary history. The novel tells the story of Captain Ahab’s obsessive quest to hunt down the
            white whale, Moby-Dick, and explores profound themes of fate, obsession, the limits of knowledge, and the
            relationship between humanity and nature.Though Moby-Dick initially received mixed reviews and did not
            achieve commercial success, it gained
            recognition in the 20th century as one of the most significant American novels. Melville's exploration of
            the human condition, his innovative narrative style, and his use of symbolism and philosophical depth have
            made Moby-Dick a cornerstone of literary study.Melville’s later works did not garner as much attention in
            his lifetime, and he spent his later years in
            relative obscurity. However, his reputation grew posthumously, and today he is regarded as one of the most
            important figures in American literary history.</p>

            <h3>"The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald :</h3>
        </li>

        <p>F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896–1940) was an American novelist and short story writer, widely regarded as one of
            the greatest American writers of the 20th century. His works often explore themes of wealth, class, love,
            and the American Dream, and he is particularly known for his portrayal of the Jazz Age, a period of great
            social change and excess in the 1920s.Fitzgerald’s most famous novel, The Great Gatsby, was published in
            1925 and is considered one of the
            defining works of American literature. The novel tells the story of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire who
            throws extravagant parties in an attempt to win back his lost love, Daisy Buchanan. Set against the backdrop
            of the Roaring Twenties, The Great Gatsby explores themes of idealism, obsession, and the disillusionment of
            the American Dream.Although The Great Gatsby was not initially a commercial success, it has since become a
            classic, praised for
            its lyrical prose, vivid imagery, and its critical examination of social and economic inequality. The
            novel’s exploration of the hollow pursuit of wealth and status, as well as its critique of the American
            Dream, continues to resonate with readers today. Fitzgerald’s personal life, filled with financial struggles
            and a turbulent marriage to Zelda Sayre,
            mirrored some of the themes he explored in his work. Fitzgerald’s influence on literature and culture
            endures, with The Great Gatsby remaining one of the most widely studied and adapted works in American
            literature.</p>
