    <h2>Overview of Pride and Prejudice</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Author:</strong> Jane Austen</li>
        <li><strong> Published:</strong> 1813</li>
        <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Romantic fiction, comedy of manners</li>
        <li><strong>Setting:</strong> Early 19th-century rural England</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
    <p>The story follows Elizabeth Bennet, a witty and independent young woman, as she navigates issues of love, class,
        and societal expectations. Key themes include the importance of marrying for love rather than wealth, personal
        growth, and overcoming initial judgments.

        Elizabeth initially misjudges the aloof and wealthy Mr. Darcy as proud and arrogant, while he misjudges her
        family as unsuitable due to their lower social standing. Over time, both characters confront their
        flaws—Elizabeth her prejudice and Darcy his pride—and grow closer, ultimately leading to a romantic
        reconciliation.</p>
